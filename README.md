Capstone Group 306: Scheduling Progress Assessments

Contributors: Andrew Reed, Anthony Rojas, Jacob Thompson, Raul Pena, Spencer Stafford

Abstract: PASC is a Program Assessment Scheduling Calendar, developed for The Diplomacy Lab. 
The main features of the application are to view, add, edit, delete, and reschedule progess assessments for research students.
These meetings will take place in person, and the needed information for scheduling an assessment is:
Student Email, Rater Email(s), Date, Time, Room, Language, and E1-E3 (Which assessment they are on)
Students are sent a confirmation email on adding/editing an event. In this email, if the time/date doesn't work for them, they can click a button which will take them to our student web panel.
On this student web panel they can submit a reschedule request, which will tag an assessment and put in the the app's reschedule inbox.
The app also generates reports on all of the assessments done by a specific rater, student, or language.
