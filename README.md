## About the Project

The Program Assessment Scheduling Calendar Application (PASC), developed for The Diplomacy Lab, is a management too for organizing and schedule progress assessments with research students. The main features of the application are to view, add, edit, delete, and reschedule progess assessments . These meetings will take place in person, and the needed information for scheduling an assessment is: Student Email, Rater Email(s), Date, Time, Room, Language, and E1-E3 (Which assessment they are on) Students are sent a confirmation email on adding/editing an event. In this email, if the time/date doesn't work for them, they can click a button which will take them to our student web panel. On this student web panel they can submit a reschedule request, which will tag an assessment and put in the the app's reschedule inbox. The app also generates reports on all of the assessments done by a specific rater, student, or language.
